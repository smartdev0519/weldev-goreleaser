You may want to wire this to auto-deploy your new tags on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org), for example:

```yaml
# .travis.yml
after_success:
  - test -n "$TRAVIS_TAG" && curl -sL https://git.io/goreleaser | bash
```

Here is how to do it with [CircleCI](https://circleci.com):

```yml
# circle.yml
deployment:
  tag:
    tag: /v[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)*(-.*)*/
    owner: user
    commands:
      - curl -sL https://git.io/goreleaser | bash
```

*Note that if you test multiple versions or multiple OSes you probably want to make sure GoReleaser is just run once*
